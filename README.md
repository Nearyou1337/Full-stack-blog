In this Application I used: **React**, **MongoDB**, **JS**, **Express**, **Node**, **FramerMotion**, **SCSS**, *etc...*
- I have implemented the **user authorization and registration function** (with an error handler)
- The ability to **exit the site and save the user to the local storage**.
- It is possible to **create posts, upload images, edit and render text, delete your posts, edit them, make tags for them**.
- **Animations** are added to the site when switching pages and scrolling.
